# androidx-rounded-polygon-qmljs

QML-compatible Javascript port of [Knugel's Typescript port](https://github.com/Knugel/rounded-polygon-ts) of Androidx's shape library.

Ported with Claude and has gone through full human revision. Most of it was stripping away type annotations so I hope there's not much that can go wrong.

To run the example, you can use Quickshell's runner:

```sh
qs -p example.qml
```
